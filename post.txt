Of course cat file1 does nothing. It just gives the file back as is. 
Useful though concatenation is, many people rarely use it, and a lot of newbies acquire the misapprehension that cat file1 means "print file1", and

Unix really does have a way to "print file1" which is <file1 - the brother of "write to file1" which is >file1
